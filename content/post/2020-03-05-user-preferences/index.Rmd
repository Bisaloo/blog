Something about customer service.

Some notes.
What: user's authentication information, preferences, data caches. look into rappdirs reverse dependencies.
setup vs no setup (asking users to save stuff in .Renviron, .Rprofile = setup; might be less painful if you help them e.g. rtweet, usethis' helpers)
guessing vs asking (rhub guesses, in general however per CRAN policies you need to ask for confirmation)
being too invasive vs easing setup and usage
