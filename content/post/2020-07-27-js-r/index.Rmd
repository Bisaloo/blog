JS and R, what a clickbait!
Come for JS, stay for our posts about [Solaris](/2020/05/14/checking-your-r-package-on-solaris/) and [WinBuilder](/2020/04/01/win-builder/). :wink:
No matter how strongly you believe in JavaScript being the language of the future (see below), you might still gain from using it in your R practice, be it back-end or front-end.

In this blog post, we shall share a roundup of resources around JavaScript for R package developers.

> Let us start by thanking Garrick AdenBuie who not only develops great materials and tools with R and JavaScript but also took the time to chime in draft notes for this post. :pray:

## JavaScript in your R package

Why and how you include JavaScript _in_ your R package?

### Bundling JavaScript code

JavaScript's being so popular these days, you might want to bundle JavaScript code with your package.
Bundling instead of porting (i.e. translating to R) JavaScript code might be a huge time gain and less error-prone (your port would be hard to keep up-to-date with the original JavaScript library).

The easiest way to interface JavaScript code from an R package is using the [V8 package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/index.html).
From [its docs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/vignettes/v8_intro.html), _"A major advantage over the other foreign language interfaces is that V8 requires no compilers, external executables or other run-time dependencies. The entire engine is contained within a 6MB package (2MB zipped) and works on all major platforms."_
V8 documentation includes a vignette on [how to use JavaScript libraries with V8](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/vignettes/npm.html).
Some examples of use include [the js package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/js/index.html), _"A set of utilities for working with JavaScript syntax in R"_; [jsonld](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonld/index.html) for working with, well, JSON-LD where LD means Linked Data; [slugify](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/slugify) (not on CRAN) for creating slugs out of strings.

For another approach, depending on a local NodeJS and Node Package Manager (NPM) installation, see [Colin Fay's blog post "How to Write an R Package Wrapping a NodeJS Module"](https://colinfay.me/node-r-package).
An interesting read about NPM and R, even if you end up going the easier V8 route.

### JavaScript for your documentation

Now, maybe you're not using JavaScript in your R package at all, but you might want to use it to pimp up your documentation!
Here are some examples for inspiration.
Of course, they all only work for the _HTML_ documentation, in a PDF you can't be that creative.

#### Manual

The [roxygenlabs package, that is an incubator for experimental roxygen features](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/roxygenlabs#css-and-javascript-themes), includes a way to add JS themes to your documentation.
With its default JS script, your examples gain a copy-paste button!

Noam Ross once described [a way to include a searchable table in reference pages, with DT](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/searchable-metadata-in-help-files-with-htmlwidgets/1078).

In [writexl docs](https://docs.ropensci.org/writexl/reference/write_xlsx.html), the infamous Clippy makes an appeance.
It triggers a tweet nearly once a week, which might be a way to check people are reading the docs?

For actual analytics in manual pages, it seems [the unknown package](https://github.com/cran/unknownR/blob/9d5cd70c15837b59ef9d215971fad82358f29ff4/man/unk.Rd) found a trick by adding a script from [statcounter](https://github.com/cran/unknownR/blob/9d5cd70c15837b59ef9d215971fad82358f29ff4/man/unk.Rd).

#### Vignettes

In HTML vignettes, you can also use web dependencies.
On a pkgdown website, you might encounter some incompatibilities between your, say, HTML widgets, and Boostrap (that powers pkgdown).

### Web dependency management

A third way in which you as an R package developer might interact with JavaScript is via helping others use and manage web dependencies i.e. in particular JavaScript libraries that enhance HTML documents and Shiny apps!
For that, you'll want to learn about the [htmltools package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmltools/index.html).

As an example, and using Garrick AdenBuie's words,

_I'd offer [xaringanExtra](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra) as a better example of a few approaches to web dependency management in R packages:_

- _[use_tile_view()](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra/blob/master/R/tile-view.R) packages custom JavaScript and CSS_
- _[use_tachyons()](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra/blob/master/R/tachyons.R) repackages an external dependency_
- _[use_editable()](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra/blob/master/R/editable.R) combines custom JavaScript with external dependencies and passes configuration options from R to the code in the rendered document._
- _Finally [use_logo()](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra/blob/master/R/use_logo.R) dynamically writes both the CSS and JS dependency from R and bundles into an `htmlDependency()`._

## Learning and showing JavaScript from R

### Learning materials

Mostly for Shiny

https://connect.thinkr.fr/js4shinyfieldnotes/

https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/js-for-shiny

https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/packaging-javascript.html

Shiny apps as packages https://golemverse.org/

### Literate JavaScript programming

https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_knitr_engines.html%23sql#JavaScript

https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/6907b428572c130982f6b3d6c91a164a15b94a30/R/engine.R#L483

https://github.com/ColinFay/bubble#knitr

https://pkg.js4shiny.com/reference/html_document_js.html

View time for knitr and one option of js4shiny, compile time for bubble and one option of js4shiny.

#### Different problem, using JS libraries in Rmd documents

https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets

https://community.rstudio.com/t/proper-way-to-do-dependency-ingestion-of-js-for-rmarkdown/64807 (that's a thing you'd distribute in a package)



### Playground
