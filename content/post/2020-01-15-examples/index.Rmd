After posts exploring [READMEs](/2019/12/03/readmes/), [URLs in DESCRIPTION](/2019/12/10/urls/), today we shall look at another important aspect of documentation: examples in the manual pages of your functions! Why write them, how to write them, and how to ensure R CMD Check doesn't try to run examples that don't work out-of-the-box (or that shows errors).

## Why to write examples in manual pages?

We've made the point for users discovering packages through READMEs. Now, for functions, they might type `?foo` or open a `pkgdown` reference page and go straight to the example parts rather than read the previous sections (about parameters, details, etc). 

Users might do that either to get a quick feel for how the functions work, or refresh their memories of it. Say you discovered the [great `pkgsearch` package](/2019/11/26/pkgsearch/) and decide to try it out. You might look at the local [or online](https://r-hub.github.io/pkgsearch/reference/index.html) reference index and then nagivate to [the help for `package_search()`](https://r-hub.github.io/pkgsearch/reference/pkg_search.html) to [read examples](https://r-hub.github.io/pkgsearch/reference/pkg_search.html#examples).

So your package should have examples for each function. The long-form docs (README, vignette) can still show functions working together and give a bigger picture, but adding executable code to your manual pages is crucial.

## How to run examples

As the user of an R package, how can you run examples you see in a package doc? (This is useful to know as a developer too!)

### How to run all examples from a man page

Locally, you could run

```r
example("pkg_search", package = "pkgsearch")
```

or 

```r
library("pkgsearch)
example("pkg_search")
```

### How to run specific examples from a man page

If you want to run only one of the examples you're reading

* You can select the lines and then run Command+Enter (Ctrl+Enter on Linux). Below is a screenshot created by [Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](https://twitter.com/minebocek) when she curated the [We are R-Ladies Twitter account](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies)

```{r echo=FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1064734591641104384")
```

* From an online `pkgdown` website, you'd use the copy button and then paste the result in your R console.
