An alternative title for this post would be "the very meta one". :wink:
In this post we shall present some principles and tips used in preparing posts on this blog, that might be useful for problem solving for R package developers and for blogging here or elsewhere.

## Choosing and finding relevant topics

A topic is relevant if it's related to R package development, and if it's covered extensively elsewhere: unless a blog post can provide more context, presentation of newer tooling, a new perspective, we are not going to duplicate existing content.
We are quite lucky that nothing is too niche for the R-hub blog. :grin:
There is also no such thing as a too basic or too advanced topic: for [advanced topics](/2020/02/20/processx-blocked-sigchld/), the introduction should make clear it might be of interest to a few readers only; for [supposedly basic topics](/2019/12/12/internal-functions/), we hope there will always be something new to some readers.

Now how do we find inspiration?
All authors of posts on this blog develop R packages or spend time helping others do that, therefore they can encounter some tricky problems themselves that can be relevant.
Then, reading places where people look for help about package development, namely the R-package-devel mailing list, the R Package Development category of [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com), the [rOpenSci forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) and Twitter can help uncover interesting questions.

A question can be a post topic on its own, as was the case for [our post about code generation inspired by a tweet of Miles McBain's](/2020/02/10/code-generation/).
Or several questions can be put together to knit a post, such as [our post about optimal vignette workflows](/2020/06/03/vignettes/)
